Genvex Optima 270 for ESPHome
=============================

This repository contains an ESPHome package for controlling a Genvex central
ventilation unit in Home Assistant. It works for my ECO 400 XL unit, and I
speculate that it works for all units based on Optima 270, although I'll be
curious whether temperature sensor values will be calculated correctly. Open an
issue so we can figure it out together.

The project is in an early stage, and contributes are welcome.
